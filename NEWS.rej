! This file documents the bugs fixed between this release, bash-1.14.5,
! and the last public bash release, 1.14.4.
  
  1.  Bugs fixed in Bash
  
! a.  Fix to `fc' so that `fc -l' works when fewer than 16 commands are in
!     the history list.
  
! b.  Fixes to the builtin getopt(3) and `getopts' to complete conversion
!     from GNU glibc getopt() to internal bash getopt.
  
! c.  Changes to `make install' to bring it closer to GNU guidelines.
  
! d.  Fixes to the expansion code so that double quotes on the rhs of
!     ${variableOPword} are handled better.
  
! e.  New/changed machines.h entries: Fujitsu UXP/M, Tandem
  
! f.  Changes to cpp-Makefile and the rest of the Makefiles to more closely
!     adhere to the GNU coding standards.  In particular, all recommended
!     targets should now exist.
  
! g.  `read' now correctly strips trailing IFS whitespace from the input line.
  
! h.  Reworked the documentation Makefile so that it does not use `texindex'
!     and `tex', but rather `texi2dvi', as per the GNU coding standards
  
! i.  If SIGINT is not trapped, a process dying of SIGINT will cause the shell
!     to act as if it had received SIGINT and break out of for, while, and
!     until loops.
  
! j.  Fixed a bug that caused the `select' prompt to be garbled under
!     certain conditions.
  
! k.  Fixed a bug that made `declare +r variable' turn off the readonly
!     attribute for a variable.
  
! l.  Fixed a bug that prevented `declare -f -r function' (or other attributes)
!     from changing the function's attributes.
  
! m.  Fixed a job control bug that allowed `fg' and `bg' to restart jobs
!     that had terminated.
  
! n.  The pathname canonicalization code now handles filenames with backslashes
!     embedded in them more reasonably.
  
! o.  Fixed a bug that caused the expression evaluator to occasionally core
!     dump when printing an error message.
! 
! p.  Fixed a bug that caused "$*" to sometimes leave a stray ^B in the
!     expansion when there were no positional parameters.
! 
! q.  Fixed a bug that caused pre-3.2v4.x SCO machines to hang waiting for
!     waitpid(2) to return.
  
  2.  Bugs fixed in Readline
  
! a.  Fix to the display code so that null prompts don't cause core dumps.
! 
! b.  Readline now recognizes that an $LC_CTYPE value of `ISO-8859-1' means
!     that it should go into eight-bit mode.
  
! c.  Fixed a completion bug that removed user-supplied opening quotes in
!     filenames under some circumstances.
--- 1,55 ----
! This file documents the bugs fixed between this release, bash-1.14.6,
! and the last public bash release, 1.14.5.
  
  1.  Bugs fixed in Bash
  
! a.  Fix to the `fc' builtin to prevent core dumps when the history list
!     is empty.
  
! b.  Fix to `getopts' to keep it from running off the end of the array of
!     positional parameters.
  
! c.  FIFOs are now created with mode 600 for security reasons.
  
! d.  The list of active file descriptors connected to files in /dev/fd is
!     now properly zeroed when allocated or extended.
  
! e.  Fix to trap so that the exit status is preserved around the command
!     executed via `trap 0', unless that command contains a call to exit.
!     If a call to exit appears, that will set the exit value for the shell.
  
! f.  Fixed an off-by-one error that caused words to be split incorrectly
!     when IFS was set to "'".
  
! g.  Fixed an off-by-one error that caused completion to sometimes fail
!     when escaped single quotes appeared in the command line.
  
! h.  Fixed a parser error that occasionally resulted in close braces (`}')
!     causing syntax errors.
  
! i.  There is now a machine description for HPUX version 10.x.
  
! j.  Fixed an obscure bug that caused machines without restartable syscalls
!     to drop backslash-escaped characters when reading here documents in an
!     interactive shell.
  
! k.  Fixed a bug that caused FIGNORE to occasionally allow some completions
!     that should be ignored.
  
! l.  New machine descriptions: NetBSD/pmax, Linux/m68k, BSD/OS/sparc.
  
! m.  Fixed a bug that caused the `vi' mode `v' command to execute the
!     original command after it was changed in the editor.
  
! n.  Fixed some substitution bugs that left occasional stray CTLNUL characters
!     in the results of variable expansion.
  
! o.  Updated machine descriptions: SCOv5.
  
  2.  Bugs fixed in Readline
  
! a.  Fix to the history searching functions so a null search string does
!     not cause readline to seg fault.
  
! b.  Fixed a bug in the completion code which caused words appearing on a
!     line after a quoted string to not be completed correctly.
