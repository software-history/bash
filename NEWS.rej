! This file documents the bugs fixed between this release, bash-1.14.5,
! and the last public bash release, 1.14.4.
  
  1.  Bugs fixed in Bash
  
! a.  Fix to `fc' so that `fc -l' works when fewer than 16 commands are in
!     the history list.
  
! b.  Fixes to the builtin getopt(3) and `getopts' to complete conversion
!     from GNU glibc getopt() to internal bash getopt.
  
! c.  Changes to `make install' to bring it closer to GNU guidelines.
  
! d.  Fixes to the expansion code so that double quotes on the rhs of
!     ${variableOPword} are handled better.
  
! e.  New/changed machines.h entries: Fujitsu UXP/M, Tandem
  
! f.  Changes to cpp-Makefile and the rest of the Makefiles to more closely
!     adhere to the GNU coding standards.  In particular, all recommended
!     targets should now exist.
  
! g.  `read' now correctly strips trailing IFS whitespace from the input line.
  
! h.  Reworked the documentation Makefile so that it does not use `texindex'
!     and `tex', but rather `texi2dvi', as per the GNU coding standards
  
! i.  If SIGINT is not trapped, a process dying of SIGINT will cause the shell
!     to act as if it had received SIGINT and break out of for, while, and
!     until loops.
  
! j.  Fixed a bug that caused the `select' prompt to be garbled under
!     certain conditions.
  
! k.  Fixed a bug that made `declare +r variable' turn off the readonly
!     attribute for a variable.
  
! l.  Fixed a bug that prevented `declare -f -r function' (or other attributes)
!     from changing the function's attributes.
  
! m.  Fixed a job control bug that allowed `fg' and `bg' to restart jobs
!     that had terminated.
  
! n.  The pathname canonicalization code now handles filenames with backslashes
!     embedded in them more reasonably.
  
! o.  Fixed a bug that caused the expression evaluator to occasionally core
!     dump when printing an error message.
  
! p.  Fixed a bug that caused "$*" to sometimes leave a stray ^B in the
!     expansion when there were no positional parameters.
  
! q.  Fixed a bug that caused pre-3.2v4.x SCO machines to hang waiting for
!     waitpid(2) to return.
  
  2.  Bugs fixed in Readline
  
! a.  Fix to the display code so that null prompts don't cause core dumps.
  
! b.  Readline now recognizes that an $LC_CTYPE value of `ISO-8859-1' means
!     that it should go into eight-bit mode.
  
! c.  Fixed a completion bug that removed user-supplied opening quotes in
!     filenames under some circumstances.

! This file documents the bugs fixed between this release, bash-1.14.4,
! and the last public bash release, 1.14.3.
  
  1.  Bugs fixed in Bash
  
! a.  The command history is now saved whenever an interactive shell exits,
!     even if on hangup or error.
  
! b.  Newline is no longer escaped with a backslash by the filename completion
!     quoting functions.
  
! c.  When building, `ranlib' is now searched for in the user's search path
!     before attempting to find it in the file system.
  
! d.  `getopts' now saves state across calls to fix core dumps when parsing
!     arguments other than the positional parameters.
  
! e.  The builtin getopt() has been greatly simplified, renamed sh_getopt()
!     and is now compiled in on all machines.
  
! f.  The default PATH has been changed to remove the leading `.'.
  
! g.  The default MAILPATH needed to be changed for a few 4.4BSD-based systems.
  
! h.  User-changable CFLAGS can now modify all of the build parameters.
  
! i.  Fixed a typo that caused AFS to incorrectly report some files as
!     executable.
  
! j.  Fixed a bug in pathname canonicalization that could cause core dumps.
  
! k.  Changes to the job control code to work around SCO kernel bugs
!     (waitpid()).
  
! l.  Fixed compilation problems on machines that defined `const' in a system
!     header file without defining `inline'.
  
! m.  New/changed machine descriptions:  BSD/OS 2.0, Irix 6.x, Amdahl UTS, SCO,
!     Linux, Stratus FTX.
  
! n.  Fixes to make empty PS1 and PS2 work correctly.
  
! o.  The \[ and \] prompt escapes are not recognized unless readline has been
!     compiled into the shell.
  
! p.  Fixed bad variable initialization that could cause core dumps on systems
!     without varargs.
  
! q.  Fixed bug that caused `bash -c exit' to return incorrect exit status.
! 
! r.  Fixed bug that did not allow `PS4=' to suppress the execution trace
!     display of `+'.
! 
! s.  Fixed bug so that quoting inside "${param[:][-?=+]word}" is honored.
! 
! t.  References without braces to unset positional parameters (`$5') now
!     cause errors if set -u is on.
! 
! u.  Fixed bug so that the rhs of assignment statements is no longer word
!     split.
! 
! v.  Changed calls to signal() to set_signal_handler() for Posix.1 semantics
!     where available.
! 
! w.  Fixed bug that caused the exit trap to be passed to (...) subshells.
! 
! x.  $BASH is no longer auto-exported.
! 
! y.  Instances of globbing characters in completed filenames (`*', `?', `[')
!     now cause the filename to be quoted.
! 
! z.  Fixed bug that caused an infinite loop if $PROMPT_COMMAND contained a
!     syntax error.
! 
! aa. Bash no longer provides a default value for MAILPATH, but will search a
!     default file for mail if MAILCHECK is set and MAIL and MAILPATH are not.
  
  2.  Bugs fixed in Readline
  
! a.  When listing filename completions, unprintable characters in filenames
!     are now translated to ASCII
! 
! b.  Fixes to make empty prompt strings work correctly, instead of reusing
!     the previously-displayed prompt.
! 
! c.  Use _SVR4_DISABLE if it is available and _POSIX_VDISABLE is not defined
!     to turn off meanings of special characters like ^C
! 
! d.  Fixed up some functions called with incorrect arguments.
  
! e.  Fixed bug with `:%' history modifier so that it now inserts the
!     string matched by the most recent !?string? search, not the string
!     searched for.
  
! f.  Fixed a bug in the line updating functions that caused stray characters
!     to be left on lines after the first if characters are removed from a
!     wrapped line so that the line is exactly as long as the screen width.
